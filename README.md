## Building Instagram from Scratch Using React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase (11+ Hour Tutorial Here: https://youtu.be/AKeaaa8yAAk)

## ðŸ“£ Summary

This application (Instagram clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Tailwind CSS. I have built the following pages within this application: login, sign up, dashboard & lastly the user profile page. There are four different pages, some are public and some are private with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data, and that data is retrieved using a custom hook.

The original Project is in the link. I have rewritten the project with TypeScript. I hope you enjoy the types check
